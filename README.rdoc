= AttrCleaner

Cleans up your model attributes. Strips leading and trailing space, and turns empty strings into nil. Only supports Rails 3.

== Installing

Add this to your Gemfile:

  gem "attr_cleaner"

== Usage

Simply add this to any model you want to clean:

  attr_cleaner

You can restrict the cleaning to specific attributes with `:only` and `:except`

  attr_cleaner :only => :name
  attr_cleaner :only => [:name, :age]
  attr_cleaner :except => :age
  attr_cleaner :except => [:age, :price]
  
Attributes to be cleaned can be inherited, so sometimes you may need both :only and :except

  # Remove :age from the list, add :name
  attr_cleaner :only => :name, :except => :age
